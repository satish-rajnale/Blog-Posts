#  Getting Started with TypeScript<T> in React 

  **First :** Open the terminal and run this command

```
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
# or
yarn create react-app my-app --template typescript
```
##### You will be get a up and running react app with typescript configurations with this template.

Now you can make changes to your App.tsx file.
 > Note : in  your tsconfig.json file strict mode is set true, while it is a good practice to have it true you might get a lot errors and feel more restrict if not used proper ways around typescripting your app.
